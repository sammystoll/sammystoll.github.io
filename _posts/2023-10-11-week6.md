This past week, I prepared a presentation to give an overview of a peer-reviewed article that focused on various methods of using machine learning techniques, specifically random forests, in longitudinal data. This article also proposed a new method specific to high-dimensional longitudinal data. From this article, I will employ one or more of the authors' techniques and evaluate their performance for my project.
