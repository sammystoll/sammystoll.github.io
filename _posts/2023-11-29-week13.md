I ran into several issues without resolution (i.e., after going to GitHub and the direct code), using the package used for longitudinal random forest from the authors of the paper I had presented previously. 

I then tried a simplified version created for more low-dimensional data since the previous method was mainly suited for high-dimensional â€˜omics data. The new method uses mixed effects in random forests.
