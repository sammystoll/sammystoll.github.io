After speaking with my advisor, he suggested that I test DynForest again using very small numbers of predictors at a time to see where the errors and issues may be occurring. I also searched one last time for similar longitudinal modeling techniques that may be available in Python. 

Unfortunately, I was still unable to pinpoint the issue with DynForest and could not find similar methods in Python.
