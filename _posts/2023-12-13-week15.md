After running into overfitting issues last week, I went back to the literature again for other methods that I could possibly use for longitudinal data (predictors) and a single timepoint outcome. I started looking at neural networks, particularly Long Short-Term Memory networks, as these are often used in sequential data, including longitudinal health data. However, given my lack of training in neural networks and their overall complexity, I did not think they would be the best fit for this current project. 

After more searching, I found a method that uses random forests to predict a time-to-event outcome from fixed and time-dependent predictors (DynForest; Dynamic Forest). I will begin preparing the data and trying this method next week.
