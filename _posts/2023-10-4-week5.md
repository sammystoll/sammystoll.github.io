This week, I dug more into the literature on using machine learning techniques in longitudinal data. Many papers focused on forms of linear mixed models (LMMs), which are quite common for longitudinal data as you can specify both fixed and random effects (i.e., having multiple observations from a single participant). I found an interesting article focusing on several random forest techniques for longitudinal data analysis. I will be creating a presentation on this paper to present to my research advisor.
