After tuning my models further with the oversampled training data, the models were still performing poorly with "balanced accuracy" set as the scoring criteria for GridSearchCV. I then fixed my imputation method to see if that would help the model performance. I ensured that the imputation was completed on each dataset (training, validation, and testing) separately to ensure there was no data leakage between them.
