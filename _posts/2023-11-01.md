This past week, I began exploring the best methods to split my sample into training, validation, and testing sets for model training and testing. "tidymodels" is a great package my advisor introduced to, as I have only used Python, rather than R, for machine learning previously. "tidymodels" has a great function that allowed me to split my sample into three proportioned sets ensuring that each participant is only in one set (keeping the identical IDs in the same set) and also stratifying by sex, as my previous tests found that sex is associated with the outcome measure. However, I found that there was some missing demographic information for some observations and had to go back to my cleaning script to fix those errors.
