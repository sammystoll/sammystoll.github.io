This past week, after fixing some data cleaning errors, I began investigating methods to handle missing data. First, I ensured that there was no bias in my missing data by performing an MCAR (missing completely at random) test. 

There are various ways to use imputation. I ran one instance of multiple imputation using the "mice" package in R. I also found a method using a package in R on multiple imputation for longitudinal data. I plan to use this method as well and compare it to the traditional multiple imputation method.
