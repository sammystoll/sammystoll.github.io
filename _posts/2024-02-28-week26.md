This week, I began to finalize all of the models. Also, I included new models that use recall as the scoring criteria for GridSearchCV instead of balanced accuracy to help improve the prediction of all cases of the positive class (Worse Depression) in cases where intervention is of utmost importance. I then incorporated these new models into my paper draft and discussed the pros and cons between the two model versions.
