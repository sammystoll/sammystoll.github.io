title: Week 8

This past week, I began to test if there are differences in depression outcomes amongst certain demographic groups (e.g., males vs. females, across employment statuses) in my analytic sample. I used t-tests (Wilcoxon test for non-normal data) and one-way ANOVAs depending on the number of groups with the demographic variable. There was one statistically significant differences amongst demographic variables. I will stratify my training, validation, and test datasets by this demographic variable when it comes to model building to ensure that varying proportions of this demographic variable do not affect the ability to generalize testing and validation results to the test set (enchance robustness of my predictions).
