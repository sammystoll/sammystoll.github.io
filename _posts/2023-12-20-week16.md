title: Week 16

Using the DynForest method I found last week, I prepared the data and ran a base model with most of the default parameters. I then tweaked the parameters to avoid overfitting issues and, unfortunately, still ran into an issue where all predictions were the same (i.e., predicting no change/improved depression symptoms). I will go back to ensure the outcome is coded correctly and troubleshoot further.
