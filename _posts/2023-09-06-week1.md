During my first week, I met with Dr. Ustun to confirm what topic I would be most interested in for my project. I selected to work with data on Parkinson's disease as I have some familiarity with the disease and would be excited to learn more. I met again with Dr. Ustun and another student from he is advising to go over the dataset I will be working with. I then began a literature review on Parkinson's disease symptomology, progression, current treatments, and possible causal pathways to find gaps in the research I would be excited to help answer. Lastly, after gaining access to the dataset, I began reading through the data dictionary and running descriptive statistics to better understand the sample and what research questions I could answer from the given data.
