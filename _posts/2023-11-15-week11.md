I spent the past week drafting a project proposal for my degreeâ€™s Independent Study, allowing me to continue dedicating time to this project. The proposal details (1) the background and importance of my project, (2) my research questions, (3) the approaches/methods I plan to use, and (4) what the outcome and learning objectives of the study will be. 

Writing the project proposal was a great way to begin drafting my final paper for this project. Further, the proposal is a shortened version of the Introduction section, including citations.
